"TensorFlow Custom Layers and Object Detection: This repository showcases custom TensorFlow layers for addition and multiplication, combined in a third layer. It includes a model demonstrating batch inference and a predefined layer for splitting input images. The repository also features a Python graph data structure with random connections. Additionally, the code implements object detection models, explores real-time inference differences, efficient object tracking, and combines model outputs to avoid duplicates. The repository further provides tools for quantizing object detection models and evaluating accuracy differences between quantized and fp32 models. Developed as part of Spritle Software Private Limited's ML Developer R&D Code Test."
